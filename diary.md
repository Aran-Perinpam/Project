# Project Diary

## Week 11 (8 December to 14 December)

**Progress this week:**
**Next Steps:**

## Week 10 (1 December to 7 December)

**Progress this week:** Finished and submitted presetation slides. Gave presentation to a number of peers, then updated the README to contain instructions for running different parts of the project

**Next Steps:** Work on the documents involved in the Interim report,

## Week 9 (24 November to 30 November)

**Progress this week:** Added quality of life change to the connect four environment by highlighting columns that the user hovers over, displaying where their disc will drop if the highlighted column is chosen. Contiuned to work on the presetation slides.

**Next Steps:** Finalise the presetation script and slides. Update the README.md file with instructions for running the experiments and game environment.

## Week 8 (17 November to 23 November)

**Progress this week:** Fully implemented the connect four two player interaction, so now a connect four game can be fully played out by two human players. Added disc placement on click, as well as automatic win/draw detecion.

**Next Steps:** Make improvements to the connect four game's interface. Begin work on the presentation slides.

## Week 7 (10 November to 16 November)

**Progress this week:** Began implementing the Connect four environment, starting with the basic game logic and disc dropping. Started work of the pygame window of the game.

**Next Steps:** Add player interaction to the pygame window, specificallly clicking which column the player wants to drop their piece.

## Week 6 (3 November to 9 November)

**Progress this week:** Added an epsilon greedy strategy to the bandit solver, and added an experiment for that strategy. Ran the first experiment collecting data that is saved within a .csv file. Began the process of plotting that data onto a graph.

**Next Steps:** Fix the output of the graph (the graph plots something other than what is expected), then start work on the Connect four environment.

## Week 5 (27 October to 2 November)

**Progress this week:** Implemented the UCB1 bandit agent, and ran it through the bandit environment and simulation. Compared the UCB1 agent to the random agent to test the UCB1's learning behavior.

**Next Steps:** Instead of moving onto the Connect four environment like stated in the timeline, perform more analysis of UCB1's behaviour and conduct a structured experiment to evaluate exploration strategies against regret.

## Week 4 (20 October to 26 October)

**Progress this week:** Implemented the initial python structure for the bandit problem solver including a Bernoulli bandit environment, simulation loop, random baseline agent, and a test for the agent.

**Next Steps:** Implement more bandit strategies starting with UCB1.

## Week 3 (13 October to 19 October)

**Progress this week:** Set up the required GitLab repository structure and added text to both README.md and diary.md .

**Next Steps:** Start the bandit problem solver proof of concept.

## Week 2 (6 October to 12 October)

**Progress this week:** Created a realistic timeline for term 1, and submitted my project plan. Started to initialise the repository.

**Next Steps:** Finish initialising the repository, add content to diary.md and README.md.

## Week 1 (29 September to 5 October)

**Progress this week:** Read background material on Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Upper Confidence Bound. Reviewed game-playing AI research to understand the idea of exploration vs exploitation.

**Next Steps:** Refine understanding of the project and its scope. Lay out realistic timeline for Term 1. Submit project plan before the due date.
