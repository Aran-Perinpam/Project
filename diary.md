## Week 5 (27 October to 2 November)

**Progress this week:** Implemented the UCB1 bandit agent, and ran it through the bandit environment and simulation. Compared the UCB1 agent to the random agent to test the UCB1's learning behavior.

**Next Steps:** Instead of moving onto the Connect four environment like stated in the timeline, perform more analysis of UCB1's behaviour and conduct a structured experiment to evaluate exploration strategies against regret.

## Week 4 (20 October to 26 October)

**Progress this week:** Implemented the initial python structure for the bandit problem solver including a Bernoulli bandit environment, simulation loop, random baseline agent, and a test for the agent.

**Next Steps:** Implement more bandit strategies starting with UCB1.

## Week 3 (13 October to 19 October)

**Progress this week:** Set up the required GitLab repository structure and added text to both README.md and diary.md .

**Next Steps:** Start the bandit problem solver proof of concept.

## Week 2 (6 October to 12 October)

**Progress this week:** Created a realistic timeline for term 1, and submitted my project plan. Started to initialise the repository.

**Next Steps:** Finish initialising the repository, add content to diary.md and README.md.

## Week 1 (29 September to 5 October)

**Progress this week:** Read background material on Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Upper Confidence Bound. Reviewed game-playing AI research to understand the idea of exploration vs exploitation.

**Next Steps:** Refine understanding of the project and its scope. Lay out realistic timeline for Term 1. Submit project plan before the due date.
